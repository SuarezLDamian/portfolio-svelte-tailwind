    <ul class="list-disc sm:mx-6 mt-12 font-lato">
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
            Technology and computer enthusiast since I was a child.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2015 I entered college (B. S. in Systems Engineering) and got involved in software development.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2019 I started my career as a back-end developer using mainly Microsoft technologies such as .NET C#, Entity Framework, SQL Server and IIS.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2020 I got curious about the front-end world and began my journey into JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React.js and React Native, consolidating as a Full Stack Developer at my company at that time.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2020 I also got into investing. First in conventional financial instruments such as stocks, options and bonds, then cryptocurrency and DeFi.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2021 I continued improving my skillset and began researching about the technology behind Ethereum. It fascinated me, so I started learning Solidity and experimenting with Smart Contracts.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2022 I continued implementing my knowledge to build DApps and continue broadening my expertise about the Ethereum ecosystem, such as L2 scaling and new ERC standards.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I'm currently working at Gilbarco Veeder-Root as a Software Engineer II, adding value to the company's flagship product using .NET Core, Blazor and JavaScript. I am part of an agile team, using the Scrum methodology.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In my spare time I like learning and experimenting with new technologies.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold leading-relaxed mt-4  text-sky-300">
            I'm always looking for new challenges.
