    <ul class="list-disc text-justify sm:mx-6 mt-12 font-lato">
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
            Technology and computer enthusiast since I was a child.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2015 I entered college (B. S. in Systems Engineering) and got involved in software development.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2019 I started my career as a back-end developer using mainly Microsoft technologies such as .NET C#, Entity Framework, SQL Server and IIS.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2020 I got curious about the front-end world and started my journey into JavaScript, Node.js, React.js and React Native, consolidating as a Full Stack Developer at my company at that time. <br>
            That was the year when I got into investing. First in conventional financial instruments such as stocks, options and bonds, then in Ethereum and Bitcoin as an active, and finally in DeFi.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2021 I continued improving my skillset, learned TypeScript and started researching about the technology behind Ethereum. It blew my mind, so I started learning Solidity and experimenting with Smart Contracts.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In 2022 I'm implementing my knowledge to build DApps and continue broadening my expertise about the Ethereum ecosystem, such as L2 scaling and new ERC standards.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I'm currently working independently as a Full Stack Web & Smart Contract Developer.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In my spare time I like learning and experimenting with new technologies.
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold leading-relaxed mt-4  text-sky-300">
            I'm always looking for new challenges.
